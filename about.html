        <h2>What is ScratchJr?</h2>
        <p>ScratchJr is an introductory programming language that enables young children (ages 5-7) to create their own interactive
          stories and games. Children snap together graphical programming blocks to make characters move, jump, dance, and
          sing. Children can modify characters in the paint editor, add their own voices and sounds, even insert photos of
          themselves -- then use the programming blocks to make their characters come to life.
        </p>
        <p>ScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming language (scratch.mit.edu), used by millions of young people
          (ages 8 and up) around the world. In creating ScratchJr, we redesigned the interface and programming language to
          make them developmentally appropriate for younger children, carefully designing features to match young children's
          cognitive, personal, social, and emotional development.
        </p>
        <p>ScratchJr is available as a free app for both iPad and Android tablets. For more information about ScratchJr, see
          scratchjr.org.

        <h2>Why Was ScratchJr Created?</h2>
        <p>Coding (or computer programming) is a new type of literacy. Just as writing helps you organize your thinking and
          express your ideas, the same is true for coding. In the past, coding was seen as too difficult for most people.
          But we think coding should be for everyone, just like writing.
        </p>
        <p>As young children code with ScratchJr, they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer, not just
          to interact with it. In the process, children learn to solve problems and design projects, and they develop sequencing
          skills that are foundational for later academic success. They also use math and language in a meaningful and motivating
          context, supporting the development of early-childhood numeracy and literacy. With ScratchJr, children aren't just
          learning to code, they are coding to learn.
